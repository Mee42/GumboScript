## 1. Do I capitalize the S in Gumboscript?

Never.

## 2. Why...?

Because fuck you, that's why

## 3. Why should I learn Gumboscript?

Because it's extremely easy to learn.
There are only two control statement, three variable types, and no input.
It's very simple, but still somewhat (somewhat) functional.

## 4. If it's so simple, why shouldn't I learn a more powerful language, like Java or Python?

Because Gumboscript is so simple you can learn it in it's entirety in just 15 minutes.
Other, more powerful, programming languages have masses of information out there
to do even simple tasks. Gumboscript comes prepackaged with everything you can use, and the tutorial encompasses everything while still being relatively short.

## Why are there no [insert_tool_here]?
