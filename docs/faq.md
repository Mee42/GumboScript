## 1. Do I capitalize the S in Gumboscript?

Never.

## 2. Why...?

Because fuck you, that's why

## 3. Why should I learn Gumboscript?

Because it's extremely easy to learn.
There are only two control statement, three variable types, and no input.
It's very simple, but still somewhat (somewhat) functional.

## 4. If it's so simple, why shouldn't I learn a more powerful language, like Java or Python?

Because Gumboscript is so simple you can learn it in it's entirety in just 15 minutes.
Other, more powerful, programming languages have masses of information out there
to do even simple tasks. Gumboscript comes prepackaged with everything you can use, and the tutorial encompasses everything while still being relatively short.

## What if I want [insert_tool_here]?

Go to [the issues page](https://www.github.com/mee42/gumboscript/issues) and make a
new issue. Mark it as `enhancement`

## I've found a bug!

First, make sure it's actually a bug.
Second, report it as an issue on [the issues page](https://www.github.com/mee42/gumboscript/issues)

## [insert_error_message_here] isn't very descriptive

Error messages are really annoying to write.
I've probably skipped over several while writing Gumboscript,
so if you find something that's not very helpful, report it on the
github [issues page](https://www.github.com/mee42/gumboscript/issues)
